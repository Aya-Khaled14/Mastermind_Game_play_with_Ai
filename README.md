# Mastermind_Game_play_with_Ai
 The Mastermind Solver is a Python game where the computer tries to guess a secret 4-digit code chosen by the player. After each guess, the player provides feedback on how many digits are correct in position and value. The game continues until the computer guesses the code or exhausts its 10 attempts.
